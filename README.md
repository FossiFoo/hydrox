## Installation

In your `project.clj`, add hydrox to the `[:profiles :dev :dependencies]` entry:  

```clojure
(defproject ...
  ...
  :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [...
                                  [helpshift/hydrox "0.1.1"]
                                  ...]}}
  ...)
```

## Usage

[hydrox](https://www.github.com/helpshift/hydrox) assists in the transmission of knowledge around a clojure project, providing in-repl management of documentation, docstrings and metadata through the reuse/repurposing of test code. The tool allows for a design-orientated workflow for the programming process, blurring the boundaries between design, development, testing and documentation.
