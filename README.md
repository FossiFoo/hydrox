## Installation

In your `project.clj`, add hydrox to the `[:profiles :dev :dependencies]` entry:  

```clojure
(defproject ...
  ...
  :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [...
                                  [helpshift/hydrox "0.1.0"]
                                  ...]}}
  ...)
```

## Usage

[hydrox](https://www.github.com/helpshift/hydrox) provides in-repl management of documentation, doc-string and function metadata, allowing for a design-orientated workflow for the programming process, blurring the boundaries between design, development, testing and documentation.

Please see the [docs](http://helpshift.github.io/hydrox) for more information.
